## Intermediate Book Store Indexes
In this project, we’ll look at how adding more complex indexes can help (or hurt!) your database. Let’s imagine we are running an online book store and need to keep track of what books we offer. We’ll be working with a database of three tables. The books table is created from the top selling books of all time. The customers and orders tables are randomly generated.

# Conclusion
This project highlighted the vital role of indexes in fine-tuning database performance. It showcased how strategic index design significantly boosted query speed for specific tasks. Analyzing query execution before and after index implementation underscored the direct impact of these optimizations, emphasizing the need for targeted and measured improvements. Overall, it was a hands-on lesson illustrating the powerful relationship between thoughtful index creation and enhanced system efficiency.
